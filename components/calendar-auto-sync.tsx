/**
 * Runs the calendar/task auto-sync loop in the background for as long as
 * the app is open, at whatever interval the user picked in
 * Settings > Calendar Sync (1/10/30/60 min — see
 * app/(dashboard)/settings/calendar-sync/page.tsx).
 *
 * Mounted once in the dashboard layout (not the calendar-sync settings
 * page itself) so auto-sync keeps running no matter which page of the app
 * the user is on, not just while they happen to have that settings page
 * open.
 *
 * There is deliberately no server-side cron doing this: Vercel Cron on
 * this project's plan only runs each job once/day (see
 * app/api/cron/reminders/route.ts), far too coarse for a 1-minute
 * interval, and a true always-on push sync would need a paid plan or an
 * external scheduler. This client-side timer is the realistic mechanism
 * for "while the app is open"; it renders nothing.
 *
 * Calendar sync and task sync each get their own timer, at their own
 * independently-configurable interval (syncIntervalMinutes vs
 * taskSyncIntervalMinutes) — previously task sync had no timer at all and
 * only ran when the user clicked "Sync Tasks Now" by hand.
